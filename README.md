![Class System Design Drawing](docs/news.gif?raw=true "News")

This project is a search application that utilizes the New York Times API to fetch and display articles. The original version of this project was created by following the tutorial "ReactJs News App using the New York Times Articles API" on YouTube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2aYEl14ekY). However, I have added new features and personalized the CSS to make it my own.

The new features I have added include:

* A navigation bar with "About" and "Contact" sections.
* A dark mode feature.
* Share functionality using the Web Share API.

The application is built with React and makes use of hooks such as useState and useEffect to manage state and side effects.

# Features

Display article information (headline, abstract, lead paragraph, author, news desk, section name, word count)
